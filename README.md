### Hi there, I'm Phillip

I've written a fair bit of code since I joined Github in 2017; a few highlights (some open source, some closed source):

- [sheetxc](https://sheetxc.vercel.app/): which I use to figure out how good a cross country (xc) race was.
- [scorexc](https://scorexc.vercel.app/): for scoring a team xc event while it's progress.
- [kelpgames](https://kelpgames.itch.io/): a moniker under which I built games with a friend for Game Jams in the summer of 2023.
- [smlt](https://github.com/pc494/smlt): a quick weekend project that allowed me to download all of my tweets after the website got taken over.

I also help out with the pyxem and orix projects (source code in my pins) which I worked on from 2017 through to 2021 as part of my PhD.
